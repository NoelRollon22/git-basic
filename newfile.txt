What is the difference between add, commit, and push?

git add -Add the changes in the specified files/directories to the staging area.
git commit -Bundle up all the changes in the staging area into a single commit object, and add that commit to the current branch, in the local repository.
git push -Find the remote repository specified in the local repository's configuration, find out what commits on the local branch are not present in the upstream branch, and send those commits.
